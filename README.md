# Anonymous Proxy

Anonymous Proxy is a HTML and SASS (SCSS) web layout project built and developed by Yara Paz Gordillo (junior Front End Developer) as part of her final evaluation of Adalab's Web Programming Bootcamp Module 1.

In this project you will find a complete responsive Front-End solutions website following the subsequent guidelines:

1. "Header" section must be fixed and follow us as we scroll down the page.

2. "Hero" section must be edited using **Flexbox**.

3. "Tips" section must be edited using either **Flexbox** or **Grid** (in this case, we decided to work with Grid to learn more about its properties and develop half of the project using Flexbox and the other hal using Grid).

4. "Reasons" section must be edited using **Grid**.

5. "Footer" section must be edited using **Flexbox** and all nav items must lead to Adalab's website.

Furthermore implementing the following interactions:

1. The arrow button on "Hero" section must lead to the "Reasons" section.

2. The arrow button on "Footer" section must lead to the top of the page (in this case, given the small size of our header, we decided the best section to redirect was the hero)

3. All links on "Footer" section must lead to Adalab's website.

4. Buttons pseudo-class _hover_ must have a _transform_ attribute (**BONUS: include a transition to that _Transform_ as well**). As an extra bonus we included as well an _active_ pseudo-class to change the color of the button when clicking it.

5. (**BONUS: Include an animation on Footer's arrow button**)

Following all these steps the final product is the one you can find in the Github Page link attached on the main page of this repository.

Thanks for your attention and I hope you enjoy this mock up!
