# Anonymous Proxy

Anonymous Proxy is a HTML and SASS (SCSS) web layout project built and developed by Yara Paz Gordillo (future Front End Developer) as part of her final evaluation of Adalab's Web Programming Bootcamp Module 1.

In this project you will find a complete responsive website following the subsequent guidelines:

1. Header must be fixed and follow us as we scroll down the page.

2. "Hero" section must be edited using **Flexbox**.

3. "Tips" section must be edited using either **Flexbox** or **Grid** (in our case, we decided to work with Grid to learn more about its properties).

4. "Reasons" section must be edited using **Grid**.

5. "Footer" section must be edited using **Flexbox** and all nav items must lead to Adalab's website.

Furthermore implementing the following interactions:

1. The arrow button on "Hero" section must lead to the "Reasons" section.

2. The arrow button on "Footer" section must lead to the top of the page.

3. All links on "Footer" section must lead to Adalab's website.

4. Buttons hover must have a _transform_ (**BONUS: include a transition to that _Transform_**).

5. (**BONUS: Include an animation on Footer's arrow button**)
